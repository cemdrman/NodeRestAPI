The body-parser module is just a middleware we use to parse our data sent through HTTP requests.




module.exports = app;
This file will be used for configuring the app, and that alone.
All of the logic will be put in its respective directory regarding the specific feature it will be implementing. 
We use module.exports to make this app object visible to the rest of the program when we call for it using require().


Let’s just make a quick intro to REST, to better understand the 4 actions we have on our disposal to interact with a database. They are called CRUD. Standing for Create, Read, Update and Delete. Using HTTP requests, we can use the respective action to trigger every of these four CRUD operations.
    POST is used to send data to a server — Create
    GET is used to fetch data from a server — Read
    PUT is used to send and update data — Update
    DELETE is used to delete data — Delete
The best way to understand this is to jump right in.
